TENTS - Real-Time Strategy Game

*********************PROJECT IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED*********************

Tents is going to be a simple, STR game placed in harsh, desert landscapce.
Player is leading a small tribe of nomads, trying to survive as long as 
possible, wich would be the main game's purpose. Player is starting the game 
with a few tribe members - basic unit, and one Great Tent - main structure.

Resources in game:
Water - most important resource in the game. Each living unit is draining a 
small portion of water from one, common source of CollectedWater of the 
player. Once unable to, units are beging to slowly lose health. Water can be 
get from many different WaterSources in the level by players unit and 
delivered to closesed Great Tent, to be added to player's CollectedWater.
Wood - Gathered from trees and branches. Used to build new Structures and
equipment for units.
Leather - Gathered from killed animals. Used to build new Structures and
equipment for units.

Objects in the game:
Units - planned to be a few different kinds, with different levels of stats:
Health, Amount of Water needed to survive, amount of Water able to carry, 
Dehydration Rate (how fast is unit losing health while unable to drink).
Stuctures - build from wood and leather. Player will start with Great Tent,
where he can create new units, and gather all recources. Others will be:
Family Tent (enabling new units to be created), Inventors Tent (for creating 
new equipment). Mechanics unique for the game would be deassebling Tents and
moving them to other location in search for resources, that are running out 
fast.
Water Sources - lakes, puddles, rivers. All with limited amount of water, 
running out as player is gathering water from them.
Animals - more or less agresive, neutral units.
